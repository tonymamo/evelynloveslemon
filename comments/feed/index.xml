		<description><![CDATA[I have known Meaghan my entire life, and throughout our time together, she has been one of the most creative and compassionate people that I have had the pleasure of knowing. Through her compassion, not only for others but for the Earth around her and the multitude of beautiful vegetation abound, she has been able to skillfully create some exquisite art with her floral designs.

I highly recommend Meaghan to anybody looking for a true artist to not only decorate their event(s), but to create living work of art that can be shared by your family and friends.

Kudos to Meaghan and her amazing work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HI, Meaghan!  Thanks so much for reaching out today!  Sorry I didn&#039;t get your message timely.  I work weekdays and today had a few more errands that usual, and thus I didn&#039;t look at my phone all afternoon!  I am just sitting down to take a breath!  I will give you a call sometime soon to chat for a few.  I love your style, and loved the flowers (even when they were 2 weeks old when I saw them LOL) that you used in your design for your friend&#039;s wedding!  Take care.]]></description>
