		<description><![CDATA[HI, Meaghan!  Thanks so much for reaching out today!  Sorry I didn&#039;t get your message timely.  I work weekdays and today had a few more errands that usual, and thus I didn&#039;t look at my phone all afternoon!  I am just sitting down to take a breath!  I will give you a call sometime soon to chat for a few.  I love your style, and loved the flowers (even when they were 2 weeks old when I saw them LOL) that you used in your design for your friend&#039;s wedding!  Take care.]]></description>
