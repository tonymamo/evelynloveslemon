				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started my business I have been getting the question, who is Evelyn? The short answer is, Evelyn is my Grandmother. Like most people with nine decades behind them, she was many things in her life. She is an artist, a mother of seven children (including my father), and a wife to her husband Alfred for over sixty years. The one thing she has always been and continues to be is, beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_138" style="width: 1428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy.jpg"><img class="wp-image-138 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy.jpg" alt="My grandmother Evelyn on her wedding day." width="1418" height="1747" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy.jpg 1418w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy-244x300.jpg 244w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy-831x1024.jpg 831w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/evy-500x616.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1418px) 100vw, 1418px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My grandmother Evelyn on her wedding day.</p></div>
<p>Anyone who knows my Grandmother would agree she is a beautiful woman. However, her beauty is not conventional or typical. Her beauty comes from within and reflects off every interaction she shares with another. Her celebration of beauty is graceful and organic, but not at all quiet. It shows through in her style of clothes, her bold earrings, and her signature color red. My Grandmotherâ€™s ability to create and appreciate beauty has always inspired me.</p>
<div id="attachment_129" style="width: 2336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016.jpg"><img class="wp-image-129 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016.jpg" alt="Peonies painted by my grandmother" width="2326" height="1857" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016.jpg 2326w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016-300x240.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016-1024x818.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_1016-500x399.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 2326px) 100vw, 2326px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peonies painted by my grandmother</p></div>
<p>There was a time in my life when I struggled with what my appreciation for beauty meant. At times, I felt like I would be judged as vain or shallow if I gave too much time and energy to esthetics. This left me feeling conflicted because naturally, I was drawn to creating beautiful things. Having my Grandmother as an example helped me settle that conflict. There was nothing shallow or silly about her. She celebrated beauty and there was nothing vain or arrogant about the way she did it. My Grandmother taught me how to honor the beauty in life, and for that I am forever grateful.</p>
<p>When it came time to decide on a name for my new business, it only seemed natural to use Evelyn. Her example has been an endless supply of inspiration and education. Without her, I am not sure I would have had the courage to embrace the beauty that truly moves me. I owe my Grandmother much more but using her name was my way of honoring the beauty I see in her.</p>
